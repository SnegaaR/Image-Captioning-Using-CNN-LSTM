# Image-Captioning-Using-CNN-LSTM

**“A picture is worth a thousand words. But sometimes we actually want the words.”**

Captioning images automatically is one of the basic and important skills of 
the human visual system. It is the process of generating a textual 
description from images. It has emerged as a challenging and important research area following advances 
in statistical language modelling and image recognition. It includes the labelling of an image 
with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training.

For the Language part, we use Recurrent Neural Networks and for the Image part, we use 
Convolutional Neural Networks to obtain the feature vectors respectively.

The potential uses of image captioning are aiding the visually impaired, in self-driving cars 
and reduce vehicle accidents.

The report for the same is uploaded [here](https://github.com/SnegaaR/Image-Captioning-Using-CNN-LSTM/blob/main/Image%20Captioning%20Report.pdf).
